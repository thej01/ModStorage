### 1. What's Chaos Blast?
Using chaos energy, if you hold Parry, Press the cyloop button, and then let go of Parry, you'll perform Chaos Blast hurting every enemy in the area. This will cost rings though, so use it wisely!

### 2. What are Chaos Blast's Limitations?
Well, it has a cooldown of about 1 minute. This cooldown can be circumvented a bit by building a big combo though, as that will make it recharge faster.

### 3. Can I use Chaos Blast in my mod(s)?
Yes! 
Just give credit to me, please. Other wise go ham, modify it, include it, buff it, nerf it, whatever you want!
